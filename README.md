Example app demonstrating that Firefox and Chrome treat relative paths differently - Firefox treats sourceURL lines in a js file as relative to the JS file, but Chrome treats them as relative to the html page which loaded the JS to begin with.

Run `sh start.sh` as an easy way to see the requests each browser makes.

Results in Firefox when loading `/index.html` ("seems to work" from my perspective):

Results in Chrome when loading `/index.html` ("seems to be broken" from my perspective):

Example with another html file in a different directory, showing that the paths ought to be relative to the JS file, not HTML:
